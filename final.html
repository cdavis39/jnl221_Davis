			<p>Cornell University, Syracuse University, Vassar College, Hamilton College, Colgate University, RPI and RIT. They are all prestigious private institutes located in Upstate New York with a rich history. Vassar was the 2nd institute to offer higher education for women in the United States. SU and Cornell are some of the first institutes to admit women applicants. Shirley Ann Jackson was elected president at RPI, the first African American female university in United States history. Hamilton and Colgate are great liberal arts colleges that allow students to express themselves. But despite the amazing aspects of each institute, there is a thorn.<p>
			
			<p>Universities are sued each year by female faculty members for the pay gap. In October 2020, Princeton University paid women professors over $1 million for pay discrimination. In 2021, Syracuse University paid nearly $4 million to five women faculty members to resolve allegations of compensation discrimination in the workforce.<p>

			<P>Recently, five faculty members of Vassar College sued the institute for wage discrimination. The list goes on… but these three cases are unique because discrimination goes against each institute’s values. Along with discriminating against values, each institute is private. For private institutions, they are not required to disclose salary information to employees. This intrigued me- so I examined 2022 tax filings for each upstate NY college listed on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace" target="_blank">ProPublica</a></p>

			<p>The role of women faculty members at universities is growing. Women in academia are acquiring more leadership roles today. Since 2015, the number of women in top management positions has increased from 17 to 28 percent, and the representation of women at the vice president and senior vice president levels has also improved significantly stated by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace" target="_blank">McKinsey & Company</a><p> Chief officer positions, vice president roles, and dean were popular professions for women in the dataset. For example, A female chief investment officer (CIO) at Hamilton College earns $1.2M. But this is only one out of four female faculty members that earn over $1 Million. <p>

			<p>While some roles are easier to obtain, others are not. In particular, university presidents are a position women are overlooked for. Cornell, The University of Rochester and Vassar were the only institutes to have a female president currently.

				<h3>The Pay Gap is Complex</h3>
				<iframe title="Syracuse University Provost Severely Underpaid" aria-label="Grouped Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-Z3Vwk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z3Vwk/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="300" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

		<p> According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace" target="_blank">Forbes</a>,“The gender pay gap is a complex issue influenced by various factors such as discrimination, age, working hours, parenthood (including time away from the workforce, occupational segregation, the desire for flexible work, education, and the types of jobs held by men and women.”<P> 

		<p>I chose to compare the same professions at two universities. Syracuse University’s provost Gretchen Ritter is paid $650,000 less than Cornell University’s provost, Michael I. Kotlikoff. For context, Ritter is a woman and Kotlikoff is male. At first glance, Ritter is underpaid. A 160k salary vs 800k salary for the same position is significant. Moreover, the provost is the chief academic officer at institutes.<p>

<P>Instead, I considered extenuating factors.  First, tenure is an asset for many universities. Tenure highlights an employee's willingness to stay with an institute and build upon roles. Before Kotlikoff was named provost of Cornell in 2015, he joined the university in 2000.  In contrast, Ritter has served as Syracuse University’s provost since 2021. Ritter’s compensation is perhaps lower because the two individuals joined their respective institutes at different times.<P> 

<P>Timing is another consideration with the data. Returning to the workforce after the COVID-19 pandemic was challenging for the country. In Syracuse University’s tax filings for 2021-22, both interim provost and former provosts were listed on the payroll. It is feasible Ritter’s compensation package is low because SU is still paying out both former provosts.<P> 

<P>The budget of a university can also impact an employee's budget. Cornell University has a budget of $5.4 billion, 30% more than SU’s budget of $1.637 billion. Overall, it is uncertain of the circumstances.

			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Despite the plethora of data, there were multiple drawbacks. The tax filings for each institute were from 2021-22. So, the information for each university wasn’t recent. Multiple faculty members in the dataset were also listed as “former, interim, or retired.” I cross-referenced employees in the data and not all were still employed with the same institute. No matter what, the answer is clear.<p>
			
			<p>"You'll find that no matter how you measure it, a pay gap exists." Economic Policy Institute Senior Economist Elise Gould said in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/19/women-are-still-paid-83-cents-for-every-dollar-men-earn-heres-why.html" target="_blank">CNBC article</a><p>
